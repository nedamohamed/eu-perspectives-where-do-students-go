            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>This project explores student mobility within the European Union and its partner countries. The aim is to understand what kind of trends affect the student mobility and the studnets' final choice of destination. The visualizations provide insights into the number of incoming and outgoing students, their countries of origin, and other relevant data.</p>
